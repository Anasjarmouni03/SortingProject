# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark in C

## Overview
This project implements and benchmarks the main sorting algorithms in C:

- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Heap Sort  
- Shell Sort  

The program measures the execution time of each algorithm on arrays of sizes:

1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 200000, 500000, 1000000.

Results are exported to `results/timings.csv` and plotted using GNUPlot.
